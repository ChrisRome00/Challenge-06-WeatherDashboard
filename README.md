## Description
The following site is a weather forecast application. Through the use of the OpenWeather API key, you can search for a city, and the webpage will display the city, date, an icon displaying the current weather, current temperature, wind, and humidity. After searching a city, a button is created, along with the storing of the city name in local storage, so that upon refresh buttons stay available for use. You can even clear the history (local storage) by pressing the "clear history" button, which firces a page refresh. The history buttons also searve as city searches.
